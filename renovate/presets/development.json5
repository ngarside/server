/*
	This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

	This preset enables auto-merge for all development dependencies (that is,
	dependencies which are only used as part of IaC and are not run directly
	on the server).

	These consist of Python modules and GitHub Actions steps. Both of these are
	extensively tested - modules by unit tests, and steps by simply being run.

	There is therefore very little risk of an incompatible update being
	merged, and even if one was the consequences would be minimal.

	Note that this does not include the development container due to Fedora's
	versioning strategy - see 'fedora.json5' for details.
